# Application (`sails`)

The Sails application object contains all relevant runtime state for a Sails application.
By default it is exposed globally as `sails`, but this behavior [can be disabled](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/configuration/sails-config-globals), e.g. for
use cases where multiple Sails app instances need to exist at once, or where globals
are not an option. The application object can also always be accessed on an incoming
request (`req._sails`), and inside of [model](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/models-and-orm/models) and [service](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/services) modules via `this.sails`.

> Most users of the framework will only need to know about the `sails` application object in order to access a few basic methods and their custom configuration; less commonly-used methods can be found in the [advanced usage](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/application/advanced-usage) section.

### How does it work?

An application instance is automatically created the first time you `require('sails')`.
This is what is happening in the generated `app.js` file:

```javascript
var sails = require('sails');
```




### Properties

The application object has a number of methods and properties which are useful.
The officially supported methods on the `sails` object are covered by the other
pages in this section.  Here are a few of its most useful properties:

##### sails.models

A dictionary of all loaded [Sails models](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/models-and-orm/models), indexed by their _identity_.

By default, a model's identity is the lowercased version of its filename, without the **.js** extension.  For example, the default identity for a model loaded from `api/models/PowerPuff.js` would be `powerpuff`, and the model would be accessible via `sails.models.powerpuff`.  A model's identity can be customized by setting an `identity` property in its module file.

##### sails.config

The full set of configuration options for the Sails instance, loaded from a combination of environment variables, `.sailsrc` files, user-configuration files and defaults.  See the [configuration concepts section](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/configuration) for a full overview of configuring Sails, and the [configuration reference](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/configuration) for details on individual options.

##### sails.sockets

A set of convenience methods for low-level interaction with connected websockets.  See the [`sails.sockets.*` reference section](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/web-sockets/sails-sockets) for details.

##### sails.hooks

A dictionary of all loaded [Sails hooks](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/extending-sails/hooks), indexed by their _identity_.  Use `sails.hooks` to access properties and methods of hooks you've installed to extend Sails; for example, by calling `sails.hooks.email.send()`.  You can also use this dictionary to access the Sails [core hooks](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/extending-sails/hooks#?types-of-hooks), for advanced usage.

By default, a hook's identity is the lowercased version of its folder name, with any `sails-hook-` prefix removed.  For example, the default identity for a hook loaded from `node_modules/sails-hook-email` would be `email`, and the hook would be accessible via `sails.hooks.email`.  An installed hook's identity can be changed via the [`installedHooks` config property](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/extending-sails/hooks/using-hooks#?changing-the-way-sails-loads-an-installable-hook).

See the [hooks concept documentation](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/extending-sails/hooks) for more info about hooks.

##### `sails.io`

The API exposed by the [`sails.sockets.*` methods](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/web-sockets/sails-sockets) is flexible enough out of the box to cover the requirements of most applications, and using them will future-proof your app against possible changes in the underlying implementation.  However, if you are working on bringing some legacy code from a vanilla Socket.io app into your Sails app, it can be useful to talk to Socket.io directly.  To accomplish this, Sails provides raw access to the underlying [socket.io](http://socket.io/) server instance (`io`) as `sails.io`. See the [Socket.io docs](http://socket.io/docs/) for more information.  If you decide to use Socket.io directly, please proceed with care.

> As of v0.11.4, Sails bundles `socket.io@v1.4.3` as a dependency of [sails-hook-sockets](github.com/balderdashy/sails-hook-sockets), a core hook.





### Creating a new application object (advanced)

If you are implementing something unconventional (e.g. writing tests for Sails core)
where you need to create more than one Sails application instance in a process, you _should not_ use
the instance returned by `require('sails')`, as this can cause unexpected behavior.  Instead, you should
obtain application instances by using the Sails constructor:

```javascript
var Sails = require('sails').constructor;
var sails0 = new Sails();
var sails1 = new Sails();
var sails2 = new Sails();
```

Each app instance (`sails0`, `sails1`, `sails2`) can be loaded/lifted separately,
using different configuration.

For more on using Sails programatically, see the conceptual overview on [programmatic usage in Sails](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/programmatic-usage).
